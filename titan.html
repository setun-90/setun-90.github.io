	<h3>Synopsis</h3>
	<p>Titan is a macro language for optimisable incremental search. In Titan, programs reduce terms to their normal forms according to the theory of graph reduction. For this, Titan defines:
	<ol>
		<li>A <em>reference language</em> in which to express terms, including programs;</li>
		<li>A <em>standard library</em> by which to facilitate development; and</li>
		<li><em>Implementation constraints</em> to provide performance guarantees.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Reference Language</h3>
	<p>Titan's reference language is extremely simple: it is just a preorder traversal of a term graph. The caveat is that Titan also allows partial application (per the requirement of incremental search), so parentheses are required if a function must be partially applied.</p>
	<h3>Standard Library</h3>
	<p>Titan's standard library is divided into three major categories: <em>Environment</em>, <em>Language</em>, and <em>Algorithms</em>.</p>
